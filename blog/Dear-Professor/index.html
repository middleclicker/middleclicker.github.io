      <h2 id="blog_sub_title">"We are living in a lie"</h2>
      <div id="blog"><p id="para_0_original">Dear Professor,</p><p id="para_1_original">I don't know who or where this letter should be opened, but to you, professor, I tell you, we are living in a lie.</p><p id="para_2_original">I ask you to think, what is the world you know of? Outside the "impassible boundaries," outside the residence of the border guards, out to the areas of danger which apparently no mortal has set foot on--what lies there? I hope you weren't so ignorant as to think we were born here out of thin air. The schools--why do their history lessons start from the 40th century? What has happened in those 40 centuries, and the centuries before--have we no account of their existence, not even a sliver of evidence of human activity before?</p><p id="para_3_original">I should tell you, professor, that there was a world before the lethal toxicity was discovered, and before the great dome was put upon us, to shroud us in ignorance. Beyond the boundaries of our existence lies a vast universe filled with wonders and mysteries waiting to be discovered. I speak of a time when humanity roamed freely among the stars, when we were not confined to this small corner of existence. The history of our species stretches far beyond what the dome's fabricated stories would have us believe. Ignorance is bliss, that cannot be further from the truth, for doom awaits all of us--in perhaps 10 years, 100 years, or a million, I do not know; but if we do not break out, the end is sure to arrive soon.</p><p id="para_4_original">I need your help. I know you are employed in the National Dome Protectional Committee. You developed the technology to enhance the structural integrity of the dome--active reinforcement beams, from my recall. Yet, I suspect you too are in the dark, because you still busy yourself with researching a cure for combating the poison. Rid yourselves of that belief! If you agree to help, I shall send more instructions on our plan.</p><p id="para_5_original">For all of humanity, I beg, professor, you consider this carefully.</p><p id="para_6_original">Sincerely, Eli Curtix</p><p id="para_7_original">-----</p><p id="para_8_original">Dear Eli Curtix,</p><p id="para_9_original">I must admit that your letter has left me both intrigued and concerned. While your words are filled with urgency and conviction, the claims you make about the existence of a hidden world beyond the confines of our current reality are quite extraordinary.</p><p id="para_10_original">However, I must clarify that I am not directly involved with the National Dome Protectional Committee as you mentioned in your letter, nor have I developed any technology related to enhancing the structural integrity of the dome. I am merely there to give authenticity to their dome proposals--I do not know, nor understand, their internal systems.</p><p id="para_11_original">However, as I have said, you pose a truly remarkable theory. The lack of evidence though, has made me question its authenticity. For one, how do you know of the world outside the dome? You would be dead if you should have stepped out, or more likely, shot right after entering the guard's vicinity. Though you write me this letter explaining your findings.</p><p id="para_12_original">Of course, I am open to discussing this topic more.</p><p id="para_13_original">Sincerely, Professor Alfred</p><p id="para_14_original">-----</p><p id="para_15_original">Dear Professor Alfred,</p><p id="para_16_original">Thank you for your prompt response to my letter. I understand your skepticism regarding the existence of a world beyond the dome, as the official narrative propagated within the boundaries of our current reality does not acknowledge its existence. However, I assure you that my knowledge is not based on hearsay or speculation.</p><p id="para_17_original">To answer your question about how I know of the world outside the dome, it is because I have dreamt it myself. I've dreamt about the outside world; the dreams were too vivid to be fake. The world had a blue sky, filled with lush looking vegetation and animals which have not yet had their natural instincts tamed by humans. Though the dreams always ended at a sleeping chamber down...somewhere, I cannot recall... I've been dreamt this exact dream not shy of a hundred times.</p><p id="para_18_original">My theory is that we have been injected with some liquid before being transported here. The liquid makes us forget--that is why even the eldest of us know nothing about the outside world. Mine must have malfunctioned, and I'm not the only one. I've met a friend who has dreamt these dreams too: living life, then being forced into a sleep chamber by armed soldiers. Coincidence, I think not.</p><p id="para_19_original">I propose, to lay out our hypothesis in full, that we switch to a more private communication method--something that the government cannot track. I suggest we meet face to face and continue this discussion.</p><p id="para_20_original">Sincerely, Eli Curtix</p><p id="para_21_original">-----</p><p id="para_22_original">Dear Eli Curtix,</p><p id="para_23_original">I'm afraid a meeting in person would not work. It would be difficult to travel to your region, for the border is currently closed for visitors.</p><p id="para_24_original">It is surprising that you brought up the dream, as I have had those myself. I am still not completely convinced, yet I agree to help with your cause. Please explain your plan to me, and I will see what I can do.</p><p id="para_25_original">Sincerely, Professor Alfred</p><p id="para_26_original">-----</p><p id="para_27_original">Dear Professor,</p><p id="para_28_original">Thank you, professor. Before I proceed with the plan, I want to emphasize the importance of discretion. Our communications must remain confidential, as any leak of information could jeopardize our efforts. I understand your concerns about meeting in person, so let us continue our conversation through encrypted emails.</p><p id="para_29_original">Now, let me outline our plan. On the second floor of the committee library, go to the north-facing wall and count 29 books from the left. Pull out that one, and underneath the book, a key to the storage room will be revealed. A full trip to the storage room would be too dangerous for you to undertake. Hand the key to a cleaner wearing blue jeans and a white hat. His name is John Mckee, if you want to make sure.</p><p id="para_30_original">That is all you have to do. For humanity's sake, professor, consider this your most important duty. Good luck.</p><p id="para_31_original">Sincerely, Eli Curtix</p></div>
