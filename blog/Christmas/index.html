      <h2 id="blog_sub_title">"Christmas List"</h2>
      <div id="blog"><p id="para_0_original">Snow fluttered down from the sky--small, pristine flakes, floating by, then landing to build the great blanket that covered the winter soil outside. I stood by the windowsill, the freezing cold numbing my ungloved hands. It was a great snow this year, quite unlike the stingy and miserable sprinkle we had last year. No, not last year's snow, for the expanse my eye can see, whiteness has taken over the reddish brown hue of autumn.</p><p id="para_1_original">The flame crackled behind me like a chorus of tiny applause, celebrating the dance of the glowing embers. I turned and stepped closer to the flame. My mom looked back from her busy cooking hands and announced, "food is going to be ready soon!" I believe her voice was not loud enough for the rest of the family to hear upstairs, though, I knew what she meant: don't go outside, it's almost dinner time. I didn't plan to. It was cold--a cold, cold winter.</p><p id="para_2_original">I remember the Christmas when we moved from China to Canada. We weren't used to the snow--the whiteness of it, the fluffiness of it, the coldness of it. We weren't used to the people either, how they greeted us on the streets or how they put up Christmas lights and glorified pine trees. Yet, to me, the best part of Christmas was undoubtedly the Christmas gifts: Red boxes piled underneath the great Christmas tree, put there by Santa, and waiting to be opened by the grabby hands of children. And so, each year after that, I would anxiously wait for the Christmas snow to come, for the presents to get stockpiled under the tree, and for the ringing of the bells to echo through the neighborhood. It was only until I got into middle school that I stopped believing in Santa's great myth.</p><p id="para_3_original">I put my on headphones and slid to my favorite Christmas song. "There's an angel in the snow, she's knocking at my door..." the soothing sound of Anson came through the speakers. I rested my head on the sofa, closing my eyes and allowing the music to transport me to another world. The soft melody filled the room, mingling with the crackling of the fire, creating a cozy ambiance that warmed my heart despite the wintry chill outside.</p><p id="para_4_original">I've always found music interesting. When you're in a good mood, good music is everywhere; every song seems to speak your mind, every rhythms seems to provoke a dance... But when you're in a bad mood, good songs become rare, like gems in a mine, or like water in a desert. Perhaps it is harder to capture negative emotions sincerely, perhaps-</p><p id="para_5_original">A couple knocks came from the front door.</p><p id="para_6_original">"Ah, that must be the food delivery," my mom exclaimed, wiping her hands on her apron as she hurried towards the entrance. I sat up, removing my headphones and listened intently. The knocks repeated; they seemed a little too deliberate, too rhythmic to be a casual delivery. Curiosity piqued, I followed my mom to the front door.</p><p id="para_7_original">"Well, hello! Come in, come in." My mom beckoned from the front door.</p><p id="para_8_original">I peered from behind. "Lea?"</p><p id="para_9_original">She smiled from the door, "Hey--"</p><p id="para_10_original">I glanced at her with curious eyes; I think she understood what I meant, and she followed me to my room.</p><p id="para_11_original">"Well, why...are you here?"</p><p id="para_12_original">She smiled, "to listen to some Christmas songs together."</p><p id="para_13_original">"Anson Seabra?"</p><p id="para_14_original">"Just what I was thinking"</p><p id="para_15_original">I handed her one of my headphones and gestured for her to sit on my bed. I quickly plugged the other end into my phone and pulled up my favorite Christmas playlist. She closed her eyes, I did too.</p><p id="para_16_original">We were in the same class for high school. It's a funny story. During the summer, I was goofing around with my friends and sent her one of the "dares." A bad impression was set in stone there, and so on the first day of class, I walked in to be horrified that the only seat left was at her table. I think I have a crush on her--I think she knew. I can't be certain myself though-</p><p id="para_17_original">"Then you ask me what I want this year, cause you already know..."</p><p id="para_18_original">-we both liked music, that was for sure. And our tastes in "good" music were surprisingly similar. Unknowingly, we had been moving closer. It was weird to be so close to someone, even if that person was a family member. There's that weird automatically sense which screams, "Move back!! Respect their personal space." But the other half of your mind argues that it's perfectly fine. I was a contradictory mix, yet we stayed like this for a while. It was comforting. I could hear her breaths by now and the sniffles of her nose.</p><p id="para_19_original">"I tried to make my Christmas List, But I don't want a single gift, cuz I've got everything I need, with you next to me."</p><p id="para_20_original">We sang the chorus together. I felt a slight touch at my cheeks; just a touch, or a nibble. I turned my head, twinkle in her eyes, the shadows of her face so close to mine I could smell the faint scent of left-over perfume. Before I knew it, I had my arms around her; the sounds outside drowned out to nothingness, the music retreating to the backdrop, and we kissed, softly. A nibble, perhaps, but the world went dizzying and my mind swayed around it like a fishermen on a rocking boat. She blushed, I could feel my face burning too...</p><p id="para_21_original">We stared into space for a while, like a scolded child trying to hide his smile.</p><p id="para_22_original">"So I won't ask for anything, no shiny toys or fancy things, cuz I've got everything I need, with you here next to me."</p><p id="para_23_original">"So...are we..."</p><p id="para_24_original">"yes. yes, yes, yes."</p><p id="para_25_original">Outside, the snow continued to grow thicker, and the snowflakes continued their graceful dance. We sat, gazing into each other's eyes. That Christmas, I saw love, so much love...</p><p id="para_26_original">P.S. I hope a certain person never actually reads this or it might be super weird and cringe oh god</p></div>
