      <h2 id="blog_sub_title">"A bittersweet reunion"</h2>
      <div id="blog"><p id="para_0_original">Quite a few years ago, when I struggled to walk and lived on a liquid diet, I first came into contact with a piano. The piano was for my sister; it was wild to me that my sister's fingers, dancing so elegantly on the strange, black and white machine, could produce such wonderous sounds.</p><p id="para_1_original">Eventually, through crying and complaining, I convinced my mother to sign me up for piano lessons. My piano teacher exuded sophistication and refinement; she wore the benevolent look perpetually, annoyance showed sparingly, gratification even less, though her deep-brown eyes shimmered with enthusiasm whenever she demonstrated the piano pieces. Her glossy, black hair cascaded onto the keys as she observed and corrected the mistakes my clumsy fingers made, though I could only imagine her misery when trying to reason with a three-year-old.</p><p id="para_2_original">From my recall, I thoroughly enjoyed the first year of piano. Music resounded ceaselessly from my room day and night; it became an anthem of the family, something rooted in normality. My tiny, meaty fingers could barely reach five keys, but that did not bother me. I was determined to master the language of music; Through a year of dedication, I transformed the squiggles and dots into something more familiar than the English alphabet. It was a form of expression I had never experienced before, and it deeply captivated me.</p><p id="para_3_original">Much like most relationships that grow sour, my breakup with the piano was a gradual and agonizing process. As the days bore on, the circles and lines grew into convoluted messes, quickly fading at the initial haze of excitement. Eventually, frustration was all that remained: the frustration from not knowing the note, the frustration from making the same mistake. And so, we grew distant; our conversations became less frequent, our interactions perfunctory. The piano hummed a mournful tune every time I finished a piece, and I breathed a sigh of relief every time I closed the lid.</p><p id="para_4_original">Eventually, the four-year-old told her mother to stop the classes. My mother, being the responsible and loving person she is, desperately tried to convince me to change my mind. Still, her arrogant son stubbornly declined the slightest idea of continuing piano. In the blink of an eye, piano drifted out of my life; for the next decade, the hefty, black lid remained closed, and the sullen, red cloth gently draped over the piano, locking away the memories below.</p><p id="para_5_original">A decade later, I reunited my fingers with the black and white keys. It was a bittersweet reunion; the familiarity of the piano's touch brought back memories of both joy and frustration, along with a twinge of regret for giving up on something that had once brought me so much pleasure. Perhaps I would never become a master at the art; It did not matter. As I continued to play, I knew that the piano would always hold a special place in my heart, a reminder of the power of dedication, perseverance, and the beauty of the language of music.</p></div>
